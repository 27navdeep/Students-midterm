Description:
This project is a sample application that demonstrates the integration of Postman, Visual Studio, and MongoDB. It provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing a collection of items.

Prerequisites:
Before running the project, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
Node.js
Visual Studio Code (or any other code editor of your choice)
Postman
MongoDB

Installation:
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
Setting up the MongoDB database
Install MongoDB on your machine by following the instructions provided on the official MongoDB website.
Start the MongoDB server.
Create a new database named "sampledb"

Running the Server
Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
Navigate to the project folder.
Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
npm install
npm start
The server will start running on http://localhost:4000.

Using Postman
Open Postman.
Import the provided postman_collection.json file into Postman.
